# identitye2etest
test code for Identitye2e

Assumptions:
- Given that the page only processes one plate at the time, only one CSV file with only one plate was used for this test.
- Given this is a code test, I figured CSV should be OK.
- Only Chrome is supported by this test, selenium server should be up and running, and chromedriver should be in the path directory.
